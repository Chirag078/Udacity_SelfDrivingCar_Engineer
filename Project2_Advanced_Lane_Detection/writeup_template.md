# Advanced Lane Detection
---
#### Goal : 
The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Camera Calibration
1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

##### Steps :-
- First i took the nX(number of corner in row) and nY(number of corner in column) to calibrate the camera
- then i  prepared "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0
- After that i am searching for the corners in all chess board images and if corner is found then i am appending objp into objectpoints and corners into imagepoints
- after this for conformation i am ploting the points again on images using corners which i got from previous step
- I then used the output objpoints and imgpoints to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the cv2.calibrateCamera() function.

## Advance Pipeline
##### 1 . Distortion removal on images
- Removed Distortion to the test image using camera calibration and distortion coefficients and  cv2.undistort() function.

##### 2 . Application of color and gradient thresholds to focus on lane lines 
- I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image
    Gradient & Color Threshold :
    - Absolute Sobel in x direction 
    - R and S Channel as color Gradient

##### 3 . Production of a birdâ€™s eye view image via perspective transform
 - I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the src and dst points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

    src = np.float32(                                                    
        [[570, 470],
         [200, 720],
         [1110, 720],           
         [722, 470]])
    
    dst = np.float32(                                           
        [[320, 0],
        [320, 720],
        [960, 720],
        [960, 0]])

##### 4 . Fitting of second degree polynomials to identify left and right lines composing the lane
- Using Histogram i found the peak Points which is starting points of the lane
- then i used Sliding window concept on bird eye view image and applied second order polynomial

##### 5 . Computation of lane curvature and deviation from lane center
 - Calculated the curvature from the below equation

##### 6. Warping and drawing of lane boundaries on image as well as lane curvature information
 - here it my out put image with Warping and drawing of lane boundaries on image as well as lane curvature information
