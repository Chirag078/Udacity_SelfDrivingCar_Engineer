Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",

    "###### 6. Model training\n",
    " - I decided on a simple learning rate of 0.0005 with 50 epochs, using a batch size of 90. The weights were initialized with TensorFlow's truncated_normal method, with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.1. The loss was calculated by applying a softmax cross entropy function, comparing the predicted classes with the validation set. This is then optimized with the tf.train.AdamOptimizer, which uses Kingma and Ba's Adam algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of randomized objective functions. Adam enables the model to use a large step size and move quickly to convergence without a lot of fine tuning.\n",
